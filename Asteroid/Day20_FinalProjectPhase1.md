# Group Assignment: Final Project, phase 1


## Part 1: Planning

Develop a plan for your final project with your partner.  

Your plan should include at least the following information:

* What classes will you need to create?
* What methods will they need?
* What data will they need to store?
* In what order will you implement them?
* What tests will you write along the way to verify that you're making progress?

Create a repo on github for you and your partner to share.  For today, it's OK if only one of you commits anything, but we'll want both partners committing during the week.

## Part 2: Start coding

Create a project that includes the SFML library.  Write code to open a window and draw a shape (like you did in the lab) and compile/run your program from the command line.

Create one of the classes for your project and write enough code so that you can create an object and draw it from main().  

If you want to work in XCode, that's fine, but be careful NOT to check in Xcode project files since they will lead to lots of conflicts with git!
